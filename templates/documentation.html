    <h1>Comprehensive Documentation of Pneumonia Detection Model</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The introduction provides an overview of the pneumonia detection model project. It introduces the problem statement of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images and highlights the importance of using deep learning techniques for automated diagnosis. Additionally, it outlines the objectives of the project and provides a brief overview of the documentation structure.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>This section delves into the process of collecting and preprocessing the data for model training. It discusses the source of the dataset, which may include publicly available repositories or custom data collection procedures. The preprocessing steps are detailed, covering image loading, resizing, conversion to grayscale, and normalization. Additionally, it addresses any challenges or considerations encountered during the data preprocessing phase.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Model Architecture</h2>
    <p>Here, the documentation elaborates on the architecture of the pneumonia detection model. It explains the choice of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks and provides a detailed breakdown of the model layers. Each layer's purpose and functionality are discussed, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. Furthermore, it discusses the rationale behind the chosen architecture and any alternative architectures considered during model development.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Training Process</h2>
    <p>This section describes the process of training the pneumonia detection model using the prepared dataset. It covers important aspects such as model compilation, choice of loss function and optimizer, batch size, and number of epochs. It also discusses techniques used to monitor the model's training progress, including validation data and callbacks for early stopping or learning rate adjustment. Additionally, it addresses any challenges or optimizations employed during the training process.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Model Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The model evaluation section evaluates the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics. It discusses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis. Additionally, it provides insights into the model's performance on different subsets of the dataset, such as train, validation, and test sets. Any limitations or biases in the evaluation process are also addressed.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>This section outlines the procedure for testing the trained model on unseen data. It discusses the selection of sample images for testing and the process of inputting them into the model for prediction. The documentation elaborates on how predictions are compared against ground truth labels to assess the model's accuracy and performance. Any challenges or considerations specific to the testing phase are also addressed.</p>
