 FINDINGS:
There is a large amount of fluid in the left lung, causing the lung to collapse. This is likely due to a pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the space between the lung and the chest wall. The effusion is causing the lung to collapse because it is putting pressure on the lung tissue. This can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing. The effusion may also be causing the heart to shift to the right, which can put pressure on the heart and lead to heart failure.
The cause of the pleural effusion is not clear from the X-ray. It could be due to a number of things, such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism. Further testing will be needed to determine the cause of the effusion.
