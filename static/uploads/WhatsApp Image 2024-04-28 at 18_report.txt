 FINDINGS:
The chest x-ray shows an enlarged heart with a widened mediastinum. There is also a large amount of fluid in the lungs, which is causing the heart to appear larger than it actually is. The fluid is likely due to a build-up of pressure in the pulmonary veins, which is caused by the enlarged heart. The enlarged heart is likely due to a problem with the heart's valves, which is allowing blood to leak back into the heart. The leaking blood is causing the heart to work harder than it should, which is leading to the enlargement of the heart. The enlarged heart is also putting pressure on the lungs, which is causing the fluid to build up in the lungs.

IMPRESSION:
Enlarged heart with a widened mediastinum, likely due to a problem with the heart's valves. The leaking blood is causing the heart to work harder than it should, which is leading to the enlargement of the heart. The enlarged heart is also putting pressure on the lungs, which is causing the fluid to build up in the lungs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The patient should be seen by a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment. The cardiologist may recommend an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the severity of the problem. The cardiologist may also recommend medication to help improve the heart's function and to reduce the amount of fluid in the lungs. If the problem is severe, the cardiologist may recommend surgery to repair the heart's valves.
