 FINDINGS:
The chest x-ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates, which is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions. The infiltrates are most likely due to inflammation or infection, but other causes such as malignancy or drug reaction cannot be ruled out.

The differential diagnosis for bilateral interstitial infiltrates includes:
- Pneumonia
- Bronchitis
- Tuberculosis
- Sarcoidosis
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Drug reaction
- Lymphangitic carcinomatosis

Further testing is needed to determine the exact cause of the interstitial infiltrates. This may include blood tests, sputum culture, and/or a lung biopsy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The patient should be seen by a pulmonologist for further evaluation.
- The patient should have a chest CT scan to further evaluate the interstitial infiltrates.
- The patient should have blood tests to rule out infection and other causes of interstitial infiltrates.
- The patient should have a sputum culture to rule out pneumonia.
- The patient should have a lung biopsy if the cause of the interstitial infiltrates is still unknown after further testing.
